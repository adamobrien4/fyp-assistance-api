# Final Year Project Assistance System API

The Final Year Project Assistance System API was developed my myself (Adam O'Brien) as part of my Final Year Project in Computer Systems at University of Limerick.
My FYP supervisor was Annette McElligott.
This API was developed to work with *https://github.com/adamobrien4/fyp-assistance-spa* as the frontend client.

## Project Aims

The main aim of this project was to create a web application capable of handling the initial stages of the CSIS Department FYP system, which at the time was completely manual, with little to no automated processes or workflows.

## Installation

2. Install all the required dependencies

   `npm run start`
   or
